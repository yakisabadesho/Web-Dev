        <p>Congratulations on my first post. I'm new to this blog thing, so dont judge!<br>
            Yonah's doing relatively well, today she even got out to tend the flowers.<br>
            But it rained, so she had to go inside. It's alright, flower's aren't gonna go anywhere.

            After telling Yonah about the Lunar Tears yesterday before sleep, I couldn't find her anywhere this morning.<br>
            I've asked Devola, granny near the fountain, every vendor on the shopping district. No one knew where she went<br>
            Thankfully Popola pointed me to the Lost Shrine to the east, so I rushed there.<br>
            It was desolate and full of Shades, yet the top room had 2 huge statues, they turned out to be Shades. Also, between them was a single floating book, stationary, as if it was hanged from the ceiling. It spoke to me and lent me it's power, said it's name was Grimoire Weiss or something, so I called him Weiss, to which he didn't react lightly. <br>
            Killed the Shades, proceeded forth and there was Yonah, semi-conscious. Took her home, made her dinner. All is well

        <h6>Posted February 2nd, 3461</h6>
        <p>After meeting up with Emil, who seemingly didn't change since the last time I saw him, he offered me to help him check his basement in hopes of finding anything that can help Kaine in her current, petrified state.<br>
            Turned out it was a giant, <em>huge</em> laboratory. So, bunch of stuff happened, Emil fused with his sister and became a skeleton with a weird head. He's still Emil, though.<br>
            We came back to the village and Emil used his newfound powers to unpetrify Kaine. The reunion was sweet, we let it wash over us like rain. Until Devola and Popola had to ruin it all...
